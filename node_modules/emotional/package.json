It's based on their own acquired [adjective sentiment database](https://github.com/ticup/emotional/blob/master/en/en-sentiment.xml).\n\nExplanation taken from their website (and slightly altered to fit this module):\n\n\n\nWritten text can be broadly categorized into two types: facts and opinions. Opinions carry people's sentiments, appraisals and feelings toward the world. The emotional module bundles a lexicon of adjectives (e.g., good, bad, amazing, irritating, ...) that occur frequently in product reviews, annotated with scores for sentiment polarity (positive ↔ negative) and subjectivity (objective ↔ subjective). \n\nThe emotional.get(sentence) function returns a { polarity: [-1, 1], subjectivity: [0, 1], assessments: ...} object for the given sentence, based on the adjectives it contains, where polarity is a value between -1.0 and +1.0 and subjectivity between 0.0 and 1.0. The sentence should be a string.\n\nThe emotional.positive(sentence, threshold) function returns True if the given sentence's polarity is above the threshold. The threshold can be lowered or raised, but overall +0.1 gives the best results for product reviews. Accuracy is about 75% for movie reviews.\n\n\nThis sentiment analyzer also incorporates emoticons for mood setting and ! punctuation for enhancement.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nInstall with npm:\n\n    npm install emotional\n\nImport library and make sure the database is loaded with *load*.\nThen start using the *get* or *positive* functions on the emotional object.\n\n```javascript\nvar emotional = require(\"emotional\");\nemotional.load(function () {\n  emotional.get(\"sentence\") // { polarity: [-1,1], subjectivity: [0,1], assessments: ... };\n  emotional.positive(\"sentence\") // true | false\n});\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar emotional = require(\"emotional\");\nemotional.load(function () {\n  emotional.get(\"The movie attempts to be surreal by incorporating various time paradoxes,\"+\n                \"but it's presented in such a ridiculous way it's seriously boring.\")\n  // = {\n  //    polarity: -0.21\n  //    subjectivity: 0.8\n  //    assessments:\n  //      [['surreal'], 0.25, 1, null],\n  //      [['various'], 0, 0.5, null],\n  //      [['such'], 0, 0.5, null],\n  //      [['ridiculous'], -0.33, 1, null],\n  //      [['seriously', 'boring'], -1, 1, null]]);\n  //    }\n  // i.e. it is a very subjective sentence, expressing a negative opinion.\n\n  emotional.get('Wonderfully awful! :-)');\n  // = {\n  //    polarity = -0.25,\n  //    subjectivity = 1,\n  //    assessments = [\n  //      [['wonderfully', 'awful', '!'], -1.0, 1.0, null],\n  //      [[':-)'], 0.5, 1.0, 'mood']]\n  //    };\n  // 'wonderfully', 'awful' and '!' are assessed together and analyzed as very subjective and negative\n\n  emotional.get('Today is monday!');\n  // = {\n  //  polarity = 0,\n  //  subjectivity = 0,\n  //  assessments = []\n  // }\n  // Nothing subjective here.\n\n  emotional.positive(\"This is a good movie\") // true\n  emotional.positive(\"this is a bad movie\") // false\n  emotional.positive(\"This is a good movie\", 0.8) // false\n  emotional.positive(\"This is a really good movie\", 0.8) // true\n});\n)\n```\n\n\nTest\n-----\n\nIn order to run the tests, make sure all dependencies are installed with\n    \n    npm install\n\nand then simply run with\n\n    npm test\n\n\n\nLicense (BSD)\n-------------\nCopyright (c) 2011-2013 University of Antwerp, Belgium\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright \n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in\n    the documentation and/or other materials provided with the\n    distribution.\n  * Neither the name of Pattern nor the names of its\n    contributors may be used to endorse or promote products\n    derived from this software without specific prior written\n    permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS\n\"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
